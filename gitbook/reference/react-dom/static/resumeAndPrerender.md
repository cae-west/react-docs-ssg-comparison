<Intro>

`resumeAndPrerender` continues a prerendered React tree to a static HTML string using a [Web Stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API).

```js
const {prelude, postponed} = await resumeAndPrerender(reactNode, postponedState, options?)
```

<Note>

This API depends on [Web Streams.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) For Node.js, use [`resumeAndPrerenderToNodeStream`](resumeAndPrerenderToNodeStream.md) instead.

## Reference

### `resumeAndPrerender(reactNode, postponedState, options?)`

Call `resumeAndPrerender` to continue a prerendered React tree to a static HTML string.

```js
import { resumeAndPrerender } from 'react-dom/static';
import { getPostponedState } from 'storage';

async function handler(request, response) {
  const postponedState = getPostponedState(request);
  const { prelude } = await resumeAndPrerender(<App />, postponedState, {
    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']
  });
  return new Response(prelude, {
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },
  });
}
```

On the client, call [`hydrateRoot`](../client/hydrateRoot.md) to make the server-generated HTML interactive.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters

* `reactNode`: The React node you called `prerender` (or a previous `resumeAndPrerender`) with. For example, a JSX element like `<App />`. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the `App` component should render the `<html>` tag.
* `postponedState`: The opaque `postpone` object returned from a [prerender API](index.md), loaded from wherever you stored it (e.g. redis, a file, or S3).
* **optional** `options`: An object with streaming options.
  * **optional** `signal`: An [abort signal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) that lets you [abort server rendering](#aborting-server-rendering) and render the rest on the client.
  * **optional** `onBrowserBailout`: A callback React calls when it recovers from [`browser()`](../browser.md) by leaving a Suspense fallback for the browser to replace. It receives an `Error` describing the browser-only render and an `errorInfo` object containing the `componentStack`. If a reason was passed to `browser`, it is available as `error.cause`. By default, React does nothing. [See how to report browser-only rendering.](../browser.md#reporting-browser-only-rendering-on-the-server)
  * **optional** `onError`: A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether [recoverable](#recovering-from-errors-outside-the-shell) or [not.](#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell) By default, this only calls `console.error`. If you override it to [log crash reports,](#logging-crashes-on-the-server) make sure that you still call `console.error`.

#### Returns

`prerender` returns a Promise:
- If rendering the is successful, the Promise will resolve to an object containing:
  - `prelude`: a [Web Stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) of HTML. You can use this stream to send a response in chunks, or you can read the entire stream into a string.
  - `postponed`: an JSON-serializeable, opaque object that can be passed to [`resume`](../server/resume.md) or [`resumeAndPrerender`](resumeAndPrerender.md) if `prerender` is aborted.
- If rendering fails, the Promise will be rejected. [Use this to output a fallback shell.](../server/renderToReadableStream.md#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell)

#### Caveats

`nonce` is not an available option when prerendering. Nonces must be unique per request and if you use nonces to secure your application with [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) it would be inappropriate and insecure to include the nonce value in the prerender itself.

<Note>

### When should I use `resumeAndPrerender`?

The static `resumeAndPrerender` API is used for static server-side generation (SSG). Unlike `renderToString`, `resumeAndPrerender` waits for all data to load before resolving. This makes it suitable for generating static HTML for a full page, including data that needs to be fetched using Suspense. To stream content as it loads, use a streaming server-side render (SSR) API like [renderToReadableStream](../server/renderToReadableStream.md).

`resumeAndPrerender` can be aborted and later either continued with another `resumeAndPrerender` or resumed with `resume` to support partial pre-rendering.

</Note>

## Usage

### Further reading

`resumeAndPrerender` behaves similarly to [`prerender`](prerender.md) but can be used to continue a previously started prerendering process that was aborted.
For more information about resuming a prerendered tree, see the [resume documentation](../server/resume.md#resuming-a-prerender).
